ykneo-curves
============

This is an applet demonstrating several curves for use in YubiKey NEO.

Curve parameters
----------------

The curve parameters are copied from bouncycastle's java implementation.

handy regexps to run the raw strings through (in vim) are:
s/\([a-z0-9]\{2\}\)/, 0x\1/g
followed by:
s/0x\([8-9,a-f]\)/(byte)0x\1/g
